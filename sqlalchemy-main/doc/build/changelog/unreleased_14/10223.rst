    Fixed fundamental issue which prevented some forms of ORM "annotations"
    from taking place for subqueries which made use of :meth:`_sql.Select.join`
    against a relationship target.  These annotations are used whenever a
    subquery is used in special situations such as within
    :meth:`_orm.PropComparator.and_` and other ORM-specific scenarios.
